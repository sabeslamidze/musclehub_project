MuscleHub: Data Analysis Project

This project uses Pandas, Scipy and Matplotlib to analyse and visualize A/B test data at MuscleHub fitness club. 
The goal of the project was to confirm that taking fitness tests helps accumulate more customers and increase purchases.

During the project all potential customers were divided in two groups - Grop A with the ones, who were given a fitness test
and the ones who were not - Group B.

The project revealed that Group B is more likely to purchase a membership than Group A, who were given a fitness test. 
From the char #2 we can see that the percent of applicants in Group A higher than in Group B, but this result is statistically 
insignificant because the sample size were too small.

At the same time chars #1 and #3 are trustworthy and can be used to make decision about including fitness tests in MuscleHub
marketing campaign.
